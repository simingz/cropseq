[Exploratory Analysis & DESeq2 from Alan](crop_workflow_Alan.html) (11/07/2018)

[Exploratory Analysis from Siwei](crop_workflow_Siwei.html) (11/19/2018)

In this workflow, I show how to process the raw FastQ files into count matrices representing UMI. We use the CellRanger toolkit to perform the processing. Then, we load the UMI matrices into R and perform exploratory analysis. We find that 2200+ cells have exactly 1 guide RNA and ~400 cells have zero. For the top expressed guide RNA, we perform differential expression analysis using DESeq2.
